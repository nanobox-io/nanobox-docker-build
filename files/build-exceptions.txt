# All entries in this list will be used to remove entries in the
# build-exclude.txt list which is given to rsync. Essentially,
# the build-exclude.txt list is meant to remove as much as possible from the
# final /data pkgsrc bootstrap from the final build. There are a few exceptions
# to this, and they go in this list. All entries are passed to sed in a regex
# replace function.
